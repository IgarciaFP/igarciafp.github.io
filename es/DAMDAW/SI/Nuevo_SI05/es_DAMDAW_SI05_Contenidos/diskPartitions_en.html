<p>Ana is determined to virtualize systems with type two hypervisors, as recommended by Juan. Ada, head of the company BK Programming, despite having given the go-ahead to the idea, has decided that this project does not need a budget, although she has clear ideas: she wants a fail-safe system.
<p>The computer only has two SSDs, like most laptops, and if one dedicates it to backups, it would have to contain both operating systems.
<p>Thea knows that it is a disk partitioning issue, but does not know the tools and the process to follow.
<p>He again contact Juan, who although of web programming does not have as much knowledge as she does, when it comes to using the command interface she reminds her of Harry Potter casting magic spells with words and orders that only a few wizards know.

<p>All hard drive comes from the factory with a format made at a low level by which a series of tracks and sectors are permanently defined on the surface of your plates on which the data you have to store will be recorded. This type of formatting consists of placing marks on the surface of the disk to divide it into physical sectors of 512 bytes and go numbering them, to later be able to access them when necessary indicating their head, sector and cylinder numbers. </w>
<p>During this format, your MBR (<span lang=" in ">Master Boot Record</span> or master boot record) and partition table are created in its first sector. </w>

<p>But before operating systems can burn files on them, hard drives must perform two essential operations: partitioning and formatting. </w>
<p>I save optical discs as <acronym title="Compact Disc." >CD</acronym>s and the <acronym title="Digital Versatile Disc." >DVD</acronym>s, magnetic disks, such as hard drives, and <span lang="en">flash</span>, such as <span lang="en">pendrives</span>, can be partitioned and formatted. </w>
</li>



<li><strong>Particionado de discos duros. </strong>

<p>The <strong>Particionado of the disk</strong> is an essential process since it establishes that a certain surface of the disk is treated as a storage unit with its own entity and independent of the rest of the disk. </p>
<p>To take advantage of the total surface of the disk, a single partition can be defined that occupies all its space so that it would no longer be possible to define another one, or its space could be divided among several partitions to be able to use them as if they were independent drives. You could even leave unpartitioned space, but it would be wasted. </w>
<p>We can define a <strong> disk partition</strong> as each of the divisions set up on a physical data storage unit on which a file system can be mounted. </p>
<p>Creating a partition on a hard disk consists of delimiting what part of its surface, still free, it will occupy by defining where it begins, where it ends and its size. </w>
<p>Specific applications included in operating systems or third-party utilities are used for partition management. These not only create partitions but can also perform other operations on partitions such as formatting, deleting or resizing them, and even moving them to another part of the disk whenever possible, because they are not occupied by another partition. </w>
<p>It should be borne in mind that deleting a partition means the automatic loss of the data it contains, and that any other operation such as resizing or moving partitions can also cause the accidental loss of your data. </w>

<li><strong>Reglas de particionado. </strong>
<p>Since hard drives began to be used, there has been a partitioning system based on BIOS structure. According to this partitioning system each hard disk only supports a maximum of 4 partitions called primary. </w>
<p>If for any reason it is necessary to divide the disk into more than four parts, you have the possibility of declaring one of these primary partitions as extended, thus, it will be treated as a special partition that can be divided into numerous partitions called logical. </w>
<p>New partitioning rules are currently newly implemented that are based on the UEFI standard (<span lang="en">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</span>) whose objective is to establish the way in which operating systems or boot applications should access data on the hard disk. </w>
<p>Computers that follow the UEFI standard implement on their hard disks a new way to manage their partitions using gpt, or Partition Table <acronym lang="en" title="Globally Unique Identifier." >GUID</acronym>, in which up to 128 primary partitions can be defined, making the use of extended and logical partitions unnecessary. </p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Reglas de particionado basadas en BIOS: MBR (<span lang="en">Master Boot Record</span>). </strong>
<p>The partitions for hard disks, based on BIOS, are defined and described in a data structure called Partition Table that each disk is saved in its first sector and that for reasons of space only has 4 records, which is why there can be no more than 4 partitions of the primary calls. </w>
<p> Each row in this table stores the information for each of the 4 possible primary partitions that can be declared on a disk. For each partition that is defined, you have to specify its beginning, in which sector it begins, its end, in which sector it ends, and its size, the number of sectors it occupies. There is also room to put its format identifier and the marker that indicates that it is the active partition, when it is declared as such. On each disk there can only be one active partition and it will be the one used to boot the system from it, when that hard disk is chosen as the boot drive. If the 4 possible partitions are not defined, their corresponding records in the partition table will be empty. </w>
<p>Each hard disk must have its own partition table saved in its own MBR so that the operating system that uses it can read it, recognize the partitions it has defined, and use it normally. The fact that each hard disk stores its own partition table defining its internal structure, makes it possible to move it so that it can be used on other computers. </w>

<p>Let's see that according to these BIOS-based partitioning rules we have 3 different types of partitions:</p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li><strong>The primary partition:</strong> These are the basic or primary divisions of the disk. Of these, as defined directly in the partition table of each hard disk, there can only be 4, or up to 3 and a special extended call. Each primary partition will be recognized as a separate drive by the operating system and you can use it to save files to it. </li>
<li><strong>Extensive Partition:</strong> Also known as secondary, it was designed to expand the possibility of using more than 4 partitions on a single physical disk. It is a special type of partition that is defined as a primary partition, except that its identifier declares it as extended and actually serves to reserve a disk space on which to create up to a maximum of 23 logical partitions. Only one such partition can exist per disk, and it only serves to contain logical partitions. Therefore, it is the only type of partition on which you can not write files since it does not support a file system directly. </li>
<li><strong> Logical partition:</strong> Occupies only part, or all of, the space defined as extended partition. A logical partition is always defined within the extended partition, and up to a maximum of 23 logical partitions can be defined without their total size exceeding that of the extended partition containing them. Each logical partition will be recognized by the operating system as a separate drive and like a primary one can be used to record files on it. </li>

<li><strong>Reglas de particionado basadas en UEFI: GPT (GUID <span lang="en">Partition Table</span>). </strong>
<p>For computers based on the new UEFI standard that is intended to replace the BIOS standard, new rules are used for partition management. UEFI-based hard disks use a GPT partition table on which up to 128 primary partitions can be declared. And for security a second redundant copy of the partition table is kept at the end of the hard drive. </w>

</div>
<p>All GPT hard disk uses the addressing method <acronym lang="en" title="Logical Block Addressing." ><strong>LBA</strong></acronym> (<span lang="en">Logical Block Addressing</span>) to specify the location of the blocks that form it and that are structured as follows:</p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">

<li><strong>LBA 0. </strong>
<p>In the first block of each disk, or LBA 0, a "legacy" MBR is placed, which is maintained for compatibility with the previous BIOS scheme and as protection against old hard disk software tools, disk manager type of <span lang="in">Windows</span>  NT, Linux, or older versions of disk partitioning applications, which do not recognize GPT partitioning and do not know how to properly access their partitions. </w>
<p>It is a protection MBR that declares in its partition table the existence of a single GPT partition that covers the entire drive, whose <span lang="en">System Id</span> is 0xEE, that is, type GPT. </w>
<p>When any software tries to access a GPT disk drive, it starts by reading the partition table of your MBR and detects a single partition of type 0xEE. Now two things can happen: </p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li>If it is an old software that does not know how to interpret such partitions, you will see the disk as a single partition of unknown type that you will automatically ignore since you do not know how to use it. This prevents any software from spoiling its content by misinterpreting and mishandling its true structure. </li>
<li>If the software does recognize the identifier as a GPT-like partition, you already know that you must directly access the next block in which the true partition table that represents the real structure of the disk is located and that you can interpret and use properly. </li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>LBA 1. </strong>
<p>This block is the primary header of the partition table in which the disk blocks that are available for use by operating systems for normal use are defined. But the primary partition table itself continues in successive blocks. </w>

<!--
<p>This block also defines the dimensions of the partition table, that is, the maximum number of partitions that the hard disk can have and the size in bytes for each of the partition entries. For example, in <span lang="en">Windows</span> Server 2003 64-bit you can create up to 128 partitions, because 128 partition entries are defined, each of which is 128 bytes long.</p>
<p>The table header also saves the size and GUID of the disk (<span lang="in ">Globally Unique Identifier</span>), and the placement of partition headers and partition tables; of herself, always in the LBA 1, and of the secondary, always in the last sector of the disk.</p>
<p>Also contains a checksum <acronym title="Cyclic redundancy check." >CRC</acronym>32 for the header and for the partition table, which is verified by the processes <acronym lang="en" title="Extensible Firmware Interface." >EFI</acronym> during boot.</p>
-->
</li>

<li><strong>Desde LBA 2 a LBA 33. Entradas de partición. </strong>
<!--
<p>Used to register partition entries that are composed of:</p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li>The first 16 bytes that designate the GUID partition type. They are pseudo-random numbers that identify partitions. For example, the GUID for an EFI system partition is:
<p align="center">{28732AC1-1FF8-D211-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B}.</p>
</li>
<li>The following 16 bytes contain another unique GUID for the partition.</li>
<li>The partition start and end LBA blocks, which are registered encoded as 64-bit integers.</li>
<li>Space is also reserved to save partition names and other attributes. Each partition can have a name of up to 36 Unicode characters in total.</li>
</ul>
-->
<p>For disks no larger than 2 Terabytes it would be convenient to continue using the MBR system, since some 32-bit operating systems are incompatible with the GPT system, and would lose portability capacity, especially if they are external hard drives. But for disks with capacities greater than those 2 Terabytes, which will probably need to be divided into more than four partitions, it is becoming more than advisable to use the GPT partitioning system. </w>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol></li>





<li><strong>Identifying partitions as drives.  </strong>
<p>Regardless of the type of disk to which it belongs, or how it is logically defined, each partition, whether primary or logical, will be treated by any operating system, which recognizes it, as an individual disk and will identify it unequivocally. </w>
<p>For example, <span lang="in">Microsoft</span> operating systems  treat each partition as a separate drive from the others. To identify and recognize them, assign them letters applying the following order of priorities:</p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li>It always begins with the floppy disk drives assigned the letters A: and B: if they exist at all. If these drives are not installed on the computer, their letters are not assigned and are not used. </li>
<li>Continues assigning letters, in alphabetical order, to hard disk drives (primary partitions) (C:, D:,...), optical drives (continuing in the previous order), and flash drives. However, this order can be altered. </li>
</ul>
<p>For their part, GNU/Linux systems also treat partitions as separate drives, but use another nomenclature to identify them. A prefix is used with which to recognize the type of device followed by a number (starting from 0) that identifies it unequivocally: </p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li> Floppy drives are named with the prefix fd0, fd1, etc. if they exist at all. </li>
<li>To hard drives and optical drives (<acronym lang="en" title="Integrated Drive Electronics." >IDE</acronym>) are named with the prefix hd followed by a letter, in alphabetical order, according to the order in which they have been recognized by the BIOS. Then they are given a number (starting from 0) to identify each partition. The first logical partition within the extended one, if any, will always be the 5 regardless of whether the previous ones exist. For example: the first partition of a hard drive will always be hda0, hdb0 or hdc0, etc. </li>
<li>To hard drives and optical drives (<acronym lang="en" title="Small Computers System Interface." >SCSI</acronym> and <acronym lang="en" title="Serial Advanced Technology Attachment." >SATA</acronym>) and even flash drives are named in the same way as IDE type drives but using the initial prefix sd. So for example: sda0 may be identifying the first and probably only partition of a <span lang="in ">pendrive</span> inserted into a port <acronym title="Universal Bus Series." >USB</acronym>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Formato de las particiones.  </strong>
<p>Once a partition is defined, you have to apply a <strong>stop-level formatting process</strong>, or simply formatting, with the utility of the operating system that will use it to burn your files in it, or with third-party utilities. </p>
<p>This process consists of implanting on the physical sectors of the partition a logical storage system, or file system, that allows to manage all its capacity efficiently. In other words: Formatting a partition of a hard disk is a process that implants a file system on its surface, that is, that organizes the space of the partition with logical structures that an operating system recognizes and uses to store data permanently. </w>
<p>During formatting, <span lang="en">Microsoft</span> systems usually create file allocation tables in which information about the directories and the files it will contain will be recorded. While in GNU/Linux systems blocks of i-nodes, pointers, data, etc. are created to implement their file systems. </w>
<p>In addition, while formatting, the magnetic surface of the disk is checked, and if bad sectors are detected, they are marked as wrong so as not to use them. It should be noted that when formatting a partition that has already been used, all its contents will be lost. </w>
</li>
<li><strong>System de ficheros. </strong>
<p>The partitions of a hard disk are independent of each other and each must have its own format and its own file system. </w>
<p>All partition must have a file format or system defined, so that the operating system that handles it can control its free space and its occupied space, to record or locate the information it contains. Since if a partition does not have any kind of format, it will not be recognized by any operating system as a usable drive to store data on it. </w>
<p>Therefore each partition, whether primary or logical, must be formatted using an existing file system such as <acronym lang="en" title="File allocation table." >FAT</acronym>, FAT32, <acronym lang="en" title="New Technology File System." >NTFS</acronym>, <acronym lang="en" title="Second extended filesystem." >ext2</acronym>, <acronym lang="en" title="Third extended filesystem." >ext3</acronym>, <acronym lang="en" title="Fourth extended filesystem." >ext4</acronym>, <acronym lang="en" title="Reiser File System." >ReiserFS</acronym>, Reiser4 or any other.  But considering that it must be compatible with the operating system that is going to use it, since not all file systems are recognized by all operating systems. </w>
<p>It must be the user who decides which format should be applied to each partition depending on the system that will use it and the use that will give to the partition. But you have to decide it conditioned by whether the operating system recognizes the type of file system, by the security you need to implement, by the capacity of the partition, etc. </w>
<p>Current operating systems are capable of recognizing and using different file systems, but can only work with the file systems they recognize. </w>
<p>As for file systems, we can find a multitude of types, among which we can highlight: < / p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li>Para <span lang="en">Windows</span>: FAT, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, <acronym lang="en" title="Encrypting File System." >EFS</acronym>. </li>
<li>Para Linux: ext2, ext3, ext4, <acronym lang="en" title="Journaling File System." >JFS</acronym>, ReiserFS, <acronym lang="en" title="X File System">XFS</acronym> (más los anteriores de <span lang= "en">Windows</span>). </li>
<li>Para Mac: <acronym lang="en" title="Hierarquical File System." >HFS</acronym>, <acronym lang="en" title="Hierarquical File System Plus." >HFS+</acronym>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And do not confuse the type of format or file system of the partitions, for example: NTFS of <span lang="in">Windows</span>, with the type of partition that contains it, for example primary partition. </w>

<li><strong>¿Cómo ve <span lang="en">Windows</span> las particiones? </strong>
<p><strong>System partitions</strong> and <strong>boot partitions</strong> are partition names that <span lang="en">Windows</span> used when installed on a BIOS-based hard disk. </p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li><strong>The system partition</strong> contains the files used to locate and boot <span lang="en">Windows</span>. </li>
<li><strong>The boot partition</strong> contains the operating system's own files. </li>
</ul>


<p><strong>The system partition</strong> contains the hardware-related files and boot folder that tell your computer where to look to start <span lang="in">Windows</span>. When <span lang="en">Windows</span> is installed from scratch on an unpartitioned hard disk, by default, it creates a separate system partition. It also does so when there are, before installation, fewer than three primary partitions. <span lang="en">Windows</span>create this partition with a size of 100 <acronym lang="en" title="Mega Bytes." >MB</acronym>. And it declares it as active for the computer to start from it. </w>
<p>It is a separate partition that does not contain files of the operating system, it only contains instructions to locate and load an operating system that is installed on another partition. To protect this system partition, and prevent it from being reformatted or deleted, <span lang=" in ">Windows</span> keeps it separate from other partitions and will not assign it a drive letter automatically. So the partition will not appear in <span lang=" in ">Windows; </span> thus avoids accidental use of it, although it may appear in tools such as Computer Management. </w>
<p>When your computer boots, it uses the information stored on the system partition to start. </w>
<p>The system partition can be used for:</p>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li><strong>Manage and load other partitions. </strong> If your computer is configured as dual boot or multiboot it is because you have more than one <span lang="en">Microsoft</span> operating system installed  , such as <span lang="en">Windows</span>and <span lang= "in">Windows</span> Vista. In this case, when the computer starts, a list of the operating systems that are installed is displayed so that the user can select the operating system with which to start the machine on each occasion depending on the one he wants to use. Only one system partition can exist on a computer, even if the computer is configured as dual-boot or multi-boot. </li>
<li><strong>Use security tools</strong> when your computer has been configured to run Drive Encryption <span lang=" in ">BitLocker</span>. </li>
<li><strong>Use recovery tools</strong> as long as the <span lang="en">Windows</span> recovery environment is installed on your computer  (<span lang="en">Windows</span> RE). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The boot partition</strong> is a partition that contains files belonging to some operating system <span lang="en">Windows</span>. For example, if you have a multiboot computer that contains <span lang="in">Windows</span> Vista on one partition and <span lang="in">Windows</span>in another, each of those volumes is considered boot partitions. </w>
<p>The system partition and the boot partition can be the same. There will be only one, if <span lang=" in ">Windows</span>it has been installed by upgrading to a previous system hosted on the single partition on the disk. </w>
<p>When <span lang="in">Windows</span>it is installed on a BIOS-based disk it uses partitions this way:</p>

<li><strong><H1>Discos básicos y dinámicos. </H1></strong>
<p>From the emergence of <span lang="in">Windows</span> 2000 has been added to the traditional basic disk, a new type of storage known as dynamic that is based on the use of volumes. Volume is defined as a storage drive created from free space on one or more disks, which can be formatted with a file system and which can be assigned a drive letter. </w>
<p><strong>Discos básicos. </strong></p>
<p>Are the MBR-based disks that have existed forever, those that can have up to four primary partitions that have now been called basic volumes. Partitions defined on new GPT-like disks can also be treated as basic disks with GUID-based partition tables that can have up to 128 primary partitions of 18 exabytes. </w>
<p>Basic discs are characterized by simplicity and ease of handling. </w>
<p><strong>Discos dinámicos. </strong></p>
<p>It is a storage method supported by all operating systems of <span lang="en">Microsoft</span> with versions later than <span lang="en">Windows</span> 2000. Although not all possible volume types are available in all versions of <span lang=" in ">Windows</span>. If with the basic disks we dealt with partitions and logical drives, in the dynamic disks we have to talk about dynamic volumes. </p>
<p>It is that the information related to the format of the disk is saved in a database file with a size of 1 MB located at the end of the disk that is replicated to all dynamic disks in the system and that contains the information of all dynamic disks. Dynamic disks have new features and functionality that basic disks do not. That is why we usually work with dynamic disks when it is necessary to apply some of their functionalities, such as when you have to create an extended volume in <acronym lang="en" title="Redundant Array of Independent Disks." >RAID</acronym> 0/1/5 by software. </p>
<p>This type of volumes can be of 5 types: mirrored, distributed, simple, sectioned, and RAID-5. </w>
<ul class="lista_verificacion">
<li><strong>Reputed volume:</strong> To implement a mirrored volume, also called RAID-1, or mirror, a pair of disks of the same characteristics that appear as a single entity is typically used. When any data is written to the mirrored volume, the same write operation is performed simultaneously on both disks. With them, greater reliability of the stored data is achieved, since if one of the disks fails, the system could continue to work with the other. Storage capacity is lost to the benefit of reliability. </li>
<li><strong>Distributed Volume:</strong> Distributed volumes are used to reunify areas of unallocated space on different disks into a single logical volume, rather than having many small volumes, allowing you to use the total available space more efficiently. This type of volume cannot be reflected and is not fault tolerant, although it allows to extend its size to new available units. </li>
<li><strong>Small Volume:</strong> The single volume is used to treat all the free space on the same disk as a single volume, either a single disk zone, or several areas spread over its surface. This type of volume allows to be reflected, although it is not tolerant to errors. A simple volume can be expanded within the same disk as long as you have free space left. It can also be spread across multiple disks, but then it automatically becomes distributed volume. </li>
<li><strong>Sected Volume:</strong> Also known as RAID-0, this is a variant of the distributed volume because it uses the space of multiple disks to treat them as a single logical drive. In a striped volume a special type of format is used to write, the data is distributed evenly among all the physical disks it uses. A sectioned volume cannot be extended or mirrored. It is the type of dynamic volume that offers the highest performance but on the other hand it is the least reliable because if one of the disks involved in the sectioned volume fails, the rest of the volume will fail, and access to its data will be lost. And it suffers more write failures than distributed volumes. </li>
<li><strong>SPAPER–5:</strong> A RAID-5 volume is a fault-tolerant volume whose data is distributed across an array of three or more disks. But in case one of the disks fails the data can be recovered. This uses parity, which is a value calculated from the stored data, which is used to reconstruct the data after an error occurs on a physical disk. The portion of data recorded on the wrong disk can be recreated from parity and the remaining data. A RAID-5 volume cannot be mirrored or extended. </li>
